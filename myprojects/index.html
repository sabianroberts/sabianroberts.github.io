        <h2>The Other Projects</h2>
        <h3>Sega Rally 2: Soundtrack Replacement Mod</h3>
        <small>2016</small>
        <p>
            The name of this project may confuse you, but I think that this was pretty cool. This used the Supermodel emulator,
            which was an emulator of the Sega Model 3 arcade hardware. This took advantage of the custom MP2 feature to include
            custom soundtracks. All the music here is stolen.

        <h3>Half-Life: Soundtrack Replacement Mod</h3>
        <small>2016</small>
        <p>This is the same as SR2SRM, but with Half-Life. This was never finished.</p>

        <h3>Dise</h3>
        <small>2016—2020</small>
        <p>
            Now this is the project I contributed most of my time to. The Dise project was a massive experiment to see how much music I could make
            with just samples. My sample library was limited, but I had most of the packs from Ampify Launchpad on iOS, so I was able to make a 14 track
            album in 2017 called <i>Launchpad.</i> I created a couple of other albums, and in 2020, I released the final album, <a href="https://brysonrecords.bandcamp.com/album/sky-web-epg">Sky Web EPG</a>,
            for the Dise project and announced that the project was ending. Why? Simply because, it was getting bad and it wasn't very original to be honest.
            Anyone could just look at my albums, analyse the tracks and find all the original samples I used. Also, I wasn't enjoying making new music for the project
            and more like I had all my creativity taken out of me. I stopped using the Dise alias in July and now I release original music under my real name.

        <h3>Portal: Enhanced</h3>
        <small>2017</small>
        <p>The name says it, this was originally supposed to be an improved version of <i>Portal</i>, but unfortunately that, along with a couple of other projects, never got to the end of development...</p>

        <h3>Lost and Dead</h3>
        <small>2017—2018; 2020</small>
        <p>
            This is probably one of my favourite project and for a good reason. The story behind this Half-Life mod is that amateur developer Rafael Soares was looking
            on the Steam Forums for some help on a GoldSrc project and I hit him up, and the rest is history. We made Lost and Dead to many people's enjoyment and we still
            love it to this day despite it not being in development anymore. The project was revived as Lost and Dead Classic in 2020 but didn't last very long.

        <h3>Shooter Tourneys</h3>
        <small>2019—2020</small>
        <p>
            This is a multiplayer mod for Half-Life loosely based on OpenAG. It started development in June 2019 and was released in April 2020, with
            public playtests occuring in February and March. There's not really much to say about this one, except for it's got LOADS of maps.

        <h3>Half-Life: Zombies Ate My Neighbours</h3>
        <small>2018—Present</small>
        <p>
            This Half-Life mod is the project I'm currently spending most of my time working on right now (other than this very website), and it also has a bit
            of history. Again, I made this mod with Rafael, but not only him, I'm making this with a big team of other people. This originally started out in August 2018
            as a port of <i>Zombies Ate My Neighbors</i> over to the Half-Life Engine, but the project was ditched quickly. I revived it in February 2020, and changed it
            to a ZAMN-HL crossover (hence why the code name for the game is <b>zamnhl</b>). I'm planning on releasing this mod on November 21st, 2021.

        <h2>Old Digibox Projects</h2>
        <p>I am the community manager and lead developer for Old Digibox. Hence, I have worked on a project or two for it.</p>

        <h3>Sky Web EPG</h3>
        <small>2020</small>
        <p>
            This project I actually didn't start making myself. It was someone else named Gazlene in the Old Digibox Discord server. However, since it was on GitHub, I helped make nearly all
            of the Sky Web EPG. It is a pixel-for-pixel perfect re-creation of the Sky EPG from 2005—2010. Even music works too! It comes from an M3U audio livestream I made and the music set
            changes depending on the time of day.
